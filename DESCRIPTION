Description:
    This package contain functions to run genomic instability analysis (GIA)
    from scRNA-Seq data.
    GIA estimates the association between gene expression and genomic location
    of the coding genes.
    It uses the aREA algorithm to quantify the enrichment of sets of
    contiguous genes (loci-blocks) on the gene expression profiles and
    estimates the Genomic Instability Score (GIS) for each analyzed cell.
